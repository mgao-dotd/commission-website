For personal use, you can usually assume a price range like the following: 

(table)

The prices on the lower range are for requests that are <b>clear</b>, provide all relevant <b>references for character, pose, lighting</b> and <b>not too detailed</b>. 

<header>Commission Process</header>
1. Submit Request 
You can either use the form that I provide on this website, via my Ko-Fi or just with a message on any of my social media accounts. Please try to include as much information as you can. That includes both visual references and a verbal description of the elements that you would like. The clearer your request is, the more time it saves me which allows me to quote you a cheaper price! 
2. Pricing and Timing
As soon as I receive your request, I will contact you to discuss your request and propose a time plan and cost. Usually the expected time is around 3 weeks for simpler pieces (generously planned) and 6 weeks for more complex pieces, but it depends on my workload at a given time. If the cost is too high then we can try to find simpler options to make it work. 
3. Down Payment
Once the entire request is clear, I will send you an invoice of 50% down payment. You can also pay in full upfront at a 5% discount. <b>This can not be refunded.</b>. 
4. Composition Sketch(es)
I will give you 1-3 rough line sketches (depending on how much room for interpretation there was in your request). You can get <b>one revision</b> for free,
